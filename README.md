# Retro-gaming
In the day and age of highly addictive and graphic intensive games. Lets relive the past!
When a game released in the classic retro era, that was it. There was no need to download a patch or wait for downloadable content to complete the story.
It was good to go, packaged within a cartridge for players to consume. Having a complete game was everything, and something you don't see too often these days.
In this day and age, if you're stuck in a game, a walkthrough is as simple as checking YouTube or Prima Games. However, back in the 80s and early 90s, you often had to rely on a friend or game magazine to provide you with the necessary tips.
